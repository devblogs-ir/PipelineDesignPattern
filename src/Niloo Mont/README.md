## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Niloo Mont Here [About Me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niloufar-mont/)
I'm a dotnet enthusiast, I'm looking for chances to boost my know-how and abilities.

# PipelineDesignPattern
I've created a pipeline which has two pipes. First, Authentication and then ExceptionHandling which blocks a certain IP.
***
# PipelineCLITool
A pipleline with three pipes that routes urls semi-dynamically and handles exceptions and authentication.
```
> maha-builder --ip "someIp" --url "someUrl"
```
You can send urls: localhost:7777/Products/GetAllProducts, localhost:7777/Products/GetUserById/[id]
